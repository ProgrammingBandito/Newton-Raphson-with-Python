# Newton-Raphson-with-Python

For this project, the author used Python to numerically calculate the Volumes from Pressure Values using Van Der Waals and Clapeyron's Ideal Gas Law Formulas.

In addition, a simplified 2D model of the Space Shuttle was used whereby the author used Newton-Raphson to calculate the Nozzle Angle for correct Space Shuttle flight angle.
